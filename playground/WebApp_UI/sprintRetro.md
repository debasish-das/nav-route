# Sprint Retrospective#4

## What went wrong:
* Could not decide what would be the most user friendly way to show routes with their information in due time.
* Failed to distribute the tasks properly in due time and lost focus.
* Could not integrate backend and api authentication

## What went well;
* Found a way to reduce the number API call to improve the performance and memory cost. It will also have a better user experience. But the tradeoff is there code became more complex, and hard to maintain.
* Showed more routes in a user friendly way
* Refactoring

## What could be done better:
* Implement the whole project in ReactJS with NodeJS
* Prepare wireframes for UI
